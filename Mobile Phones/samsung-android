Why Choose Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra

[Explain briefly why someone should choose this phone model. Highlight unique features, performance, or any other selling points.]
performance is at 55. and I think it's actually okay I mean it's not as good as the xiaomi 13 we've seen which can achieve almost stable 60 FPS throughout but as you can see the frame rate curve is rather flat and smooth that means there is no sudden huge frame drops most of the time it could maintain a 50 to 55 FPS
